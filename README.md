# What-To-Do-List
A list where people can add their tasks and track their progress. Tasks can be marked as completed, deleted if necessary, and added to favorites if some tasks are more important than others. You can also edit the task text if it was entered incorrectly. The program has a nice design and is quite pleasant to work with.
